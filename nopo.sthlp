{title:Description}

{pstd}
{hi:nopo decomp} does this and this.

{pstd}
It's important to not this and this.

{pstd}
Can also be used with bootstrapping.

{title:Options}

{phang}
{cmdab:by(}varname{cmdab:)} specifies to plot the relative frequencies of the levels of the plotted variables. The default is to plot absolute frequencies.

{phang}
{cmdab:swap} specifies the number of points between bars through which the flows are drawn. The default are 10 points, with a larger number increasing the smoothness and computational time.

{phang}
{cmdab:bref(}string{cmdab:)} specifies to plot missing values in {it:varlist} as well. The default is to disregard them. Note that missing values can lead to an imbalance between start and end bars or they produce flows into empty bars. Instead of using {cmd:missing}, rather code missing values as distinct values in the underyling variables.

{phang}
{cmdab:norm:alize} overrules the default of not plotting variables with more than seven unique levels. Plotting variables with many levels likely impairs readability and might take relatively long. 

{dlgtab:Options for inbuilt matching via kmatch}

{phang}
{cmdab:km:atch(}em|md|ps{cmdab:)} specifies the width of the bar. The default is {cmd:barwidth(0.1)}; values greater than 0.5 are not allowed.

{phang}
{cmdab:kmo:opts(}string{cmdab:)}}  specifies the colors and opacity of the bars and flows. List the colors in the increasing order of the values of the plotted variables.

{phang}
{cmdab:kmpass:thru(}string{cmdab:)}  allow to colors and opacity of flows, independently of the option {cmd:colors()}. List the colors in the increasing order of the values of the plotted variables.

{phang}
{cmdab:kmkeep:gen} specifies the opacity of the colors of bars and flows. The default is {cmd:opacity(80)}.

{phang}
{cmdab:kmnois:ily}} allows most of the {help barlook_options} to change the look of the bars. Note that any specified option in {cmd:baroptions()} affect all bars; specifying for instance {cmd:baroptions(color(navy))} overrides any specification of the above option {cmd:colors()} and depicts all bars in {it:navy}.


{marker postest}{...}
{title:Postestimation-commands}
  
{dlgtab:nopo summarize}

   {cmd:nopo summarize} [{varlist}] [{cmd:,} label]
   
       Reports a descriptive table with means and standard devaitions by group-indicator and matching status.
   
       If no variables are specified, {depvar} and {varlist} from previous {cmd: nopo decomp} are summarized as the default.
	   
	   Option {it:label} display variable-labels instead of varible names.
      
{dlgtab:nopo gapoverdist}
   
   {cmd:nopo gapoverdist} [{cmd:,} nquantiles(#) {help twoway_options:{it:twoway_options}}]

       Plotting decomposition-components over the distribution of {depvar}.
	   
	   {cmdab:nq:uantiles(}#{cmd:)} specifies the number of quantiles to be plotted. 
	   
	   {it:twoway_options} allows for the inclusion of any additional {help twoway_options:graphing options} such as titles, axes, added lines, etc.

{dlgtab: nopo dadb}

   {cmd:nopo dadb} {varname}  [{cmd:,} {help twoway_options:{it:twoway_options}}]
   
       Plotting contribution of {varname} to components {it:D_A} and {it:D_B}.
	   
	   {it:twoway_options} allows for the inclusion of any additional {help twoway_options:graphing options} such as titles, axes, added lines, etc.
